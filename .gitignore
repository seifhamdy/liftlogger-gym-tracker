#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/server/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/server/db/*.sqlite3
/server/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/server/log/*
/server/tmp/*
/server/!/log/.keep
/server/!/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/server/tmp/pids/*
/server/!/tmp/pids/
/server/!/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/server/storage/*
/server/!/storage/.keep
/server/tmp/storage/*
/server/!/tmp/storage/
